This game has the same features as those found in mobile phone versions. It includes background sounds, keeps track of the high score, and even offers bonus points.

Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game where players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food items scattered across the game board. The objective is to guide the snake to eat as much food as possible without colliding with obstacles such as walls or the snake's own body. As the snake grows longer, maneuvering becomes increasingly difficult, adding to the game's excitement.
